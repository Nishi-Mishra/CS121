## Mountains and Valleys

Underwater geographer is studying mountains and valleys in the atlantic ocean and models the 
terrain using integers with digits that alternate between increasing and decreasing to simulate 
the elevation changes. Given two integers **a** & **b** create a program that determines how many 
numbers model mountain and valley ranges in [a, b]. 

## Debugging, Input Validation, and Integer Overflow

Given seven functions which all run with various problems. Goal is to fix them so they run as 
intended. Add input validation and handle integer overflow gracefully.  

1. Largest 

    - takes three integer inputs: a, b and c. The function should return the largest of 
    these three values.

2. SumIsEven 

    - takes two integer inputs and returns true if and only if the sum of the two values is 
    an even number. If the sum of the input values is an odd number, then the function must 
    return false.

3. BoxesNeeded

    -  takes one input. The input value represents a number of apples that need to be packed 
    into boxes. Each box can store a maximum of 20 apples. The function should return the 
    minimum number of boxes needed to store the given number of apples.

4. SmarterSection 

    - takes four inputs and determines which section performed better on a particular exam 
    question. The inputs are: # of students in section A correct, total # of students in section A, # 
    of students in section B correct, total # of students in section B.
    
    - The performance of each section can be measured as the percentage of students who 
    answer the question correctly. The function should return true if section A performs strictly 
    better than section B and false otherwise.

5. GoodDinner

    - takes two inputs: the number of pizzas you have eaten, and a Boolean which is true if it 
    is the weekend and false otherwise. The function should return true if you had a good dinner, 
    and false if you didn't. 
    - A good dinner is a dinner where you eat between 10 and 20 pizzas 
    (inclusive) unless it is a weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of pizzas.

6. SumBetween 

    - takes two integer inputs, low and high. This function should calculate the sum of all integers 
    between low and high, inclusive.
 
7. Product 

    - Product which takes two integer inputs: a and b. The function should return the product of these 
    two values.

## String Calculator

Help someone feel better about C++ by building a calculator to do basic arithmetic operations like 
multiplication and addition with arbitrarily large numbers represented internally as strings, i.e., 
sequences of characters.

## Paris Olympics

The Paris 2024 Olympics will hold their track and field events at the Stade de France. The track has 
9 lanes. We have been asked to determine the results of heats using C++ parallel arrays 
(not vectors).

Data is shown in order of time completed, country, Jersey number and last name.
